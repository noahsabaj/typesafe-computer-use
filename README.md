**typesafe-computer-use** drives a Mac or a Windows PC toward a goal you type in plain English,
for about a fiftieth of a cent per step. It never sends a screenshot to a big model. Instead it
reads the screen deterministically, asks a small classifier which action comes next,
and only calls a writing model when a text field genuinely needs free text.

```
clicker "go to techcrunch and take me to the checkout page for the cheapest tickets to their next upcoming event" --act
```

## Why

Frontier-model computer use is capable and expensive: every step ships a screenshot and
waits several seconds for a plan. Most steps do not need a plan. They need one choice
from a short list, made quickly and cheaply, with a confidence number you can gate on.

[TypeSafe](https://docs.typesafe.ai) sells exactly that: a decision model that answers
a `Choice` over up to 255 options with a full probability distribution and a calibrated
confidence, in a few hundred milliseconds, with free output tokens. This project is a
computer-use loop built around it.

Measured on the same screenshot and goal, one decision each:

| | typesafe (jev) | Claude Opus 5, bare screenshot | multiplier |
|---|---|---|---|
| input tokens | 4,882 | 4,785 | same |
| cost per decision | $0.0002 | $0.032 | 155x cheaper |
| cost per decision, realistic loop with history | $0.0002 | $0.035 to $0.08 | 170x to 390x cheaper |
| cost per 12-step task | $0.003 | $0.40 to $0.90 | 130x to 300x cheaper |
| model latency | 0.13 to 0.38 s | 5.2 s | 14x to 40x faster |
| end-to-end step, with capture and OCR | about 1.5 s | about 5.5 s | 3.7x faster |

The honest caveat: the big model read the event dates off the pixels and compared them
unaided. The classifier needed the date parsing described below. Every piece of
reasoning the frontier model does for free has to be rebuilt here as deterministic state.

## Install

macOS 14 or newer, or Windows 10 1703 or newer. Python 3.12 or newer and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

```
git clone https://github.com/noahsabaj/typesafe-computer-use
cd typesafe-computer-use
uv sync
cp .env.example .env     # fill in the keys
```

`uv sync` installs only the adapter for the OS it runs on: Vision OCR and pyobjc on macOS,
Windows OCR, UI Automation, and pynput on Windows.

| variable | required | purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` | yes | every decision |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | no | `type_text` and writer-proposed URLs |
| `CLICKER_EMAIL` | no | enables the `type_email` action |
| `CLICKER_BROWSER` | no | defaults to `Google Chrome` on macOS and `chrome` (the executable name) on Windows |
| `CLICKER_WRITER_MODEL` | no | defaults to `claude-haiku-4-5` |

**macOS.** Grant your terminal **Screen Recording** and **Accessibility** in System Settings >
Privacy & Security. Without the first, captures are wallpaper. Without the second,
synthetic clicks are silently dropped, and `--act` refuses to start.

**Windows.** No permission grants are needed. OCR uses the built-in Windows OCR engine, so
a language must be installed under Settings > Time & language > Language (English is, by
default). The browser's address bar is read through UI Automation by its accessible name,
which is the English one for Chrome, Edge, and Firefox.

## Use

```
uv run clicker "open the Playground"                 # dry run: one step, prints what it would do
uv run clicker "open the Playground" --act           # drives the machine, up to 12 steps
uv run clicker "log in" --act --steps 20 --delay 3   # longer and slower
uv run clicker-inspect "any goal"                    # 3-2-1, capture, open the annotated screen + payload
```

Clear the terminal first. It is on screen, so its text is OCR input.

**Stopping a live run.** Ctrl-C when the terminal has focus, or slam the mouse into the
top-left corner of the screen from any app. The loop also stops itself on `done` or
`none`, on confidence under `--min-confidence` (0.4), after two consecutive no-ops, or
at `--steps`.

## How a step works

```
screen capture ─► OCR ─► merge lines into blocks ─► drop lines echoing the goal
                     │
accessibility ─► focused field (role, label, placeholder, value, frame)
window system ─► frontmost app, active tab URL
clock         ─► local date and time
dates.py      ─► "dated 2026-10-13 (in 27 days)" on any block containing a date,
                 "near a line dated ..." on its neighbours
                     │
                     ▼
        one TypeSafe request, three Choices
        ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
        │ kind  : click_item | open_site | type_text | scroll… │
        │ item  : which OCR block (used only for click_item)   │
        │ site  : which catalog site (used only for open_site) │
        └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                     │
                     ▼
        deterministic action ─► wait ─► next step
```

Splitting the decision into three questions keeps screen noise out of the action
choice. Every stall found while building this came from two options that meant the
same thing. Confidence measures concentration, so overlapping options always read as
doubt. Keep the action set mutually exclusive.

### Action space

| key | does |
|---|---|
| `click_item` | click the center of the chosen OCR block, converted from capture pixels to points |
| `open_site` | open a `SITES` catalog entry, or a URL the writer proposes, in the browser |
| `switch_to_browser` | bring the browser forward to continue with a page already open there |
| `type_text` | the writer composes the string; a TypeSafe Noul then checks the field's value |
| `type_email` | types `$CLICKER_EMAIL`; refused unless a text field is focused |
| `press_enter`, `press_escape` | keyboard |
| `scroll_down`, `scroll_up` | 10 lines, after parking the cursor over the frontmost window |
| `wait` | screen still loading |
| `done`, `none` | stop |

### Where free text comes from

The classifier never generates text. The writer model runs in two places, each with a
small packet and a structured reply:

- **`type_text`** receives the goal, recent actions, the focused field's label and
  placeholder, and the OCR lines near the field. It returns `{fill, text}`. Credential
  fields come back `fill: false` and nothing is typed. After typing, a Noul scores
  whether the field now holds a sensible value. Under 0.5 the field is cleared.
- **`open_site`** with no catalog match receives the goal and returns `{ok, url}`.
  Code rejects anything that is not a clean https URL with a hostname.

Passwords are never typed. Rely on the browser's password manager or an SSO button
the OCR can read.

## Run folder

Every run writes `runs/<timestamp>/` so a stall can be replayed and fixed offline:

| file | contents |
|---|---|
| `run.log`, `run.json` | everything printed; goal, outcome, seconds, every action, config |
| `step-NN-raw.png` | the capture |
| `step-NN.png` | OCR blocks numbered in blue, the chosen one red, the focused field green |
| `step-NN-payload.txt` | the exact `state` and criteria sent to TypeSafe, then every block with box, click point, confidence |
| `step-NN-answers.json` | every probability the classifier returned |

Replay a saved capture as if it were live, without touching the screen:

```
uv run clicker "same goal" --image runs/<ts>/step-03-raw.png --app "Google Chrome" --url "https://example.com/"
```

Run folders from either OS replay on the other: the capture, app name, and URL are all
the model sees.

## Layout

```
typesafe_computer_use/
  host.py         picks the adapter for this OS; everything else imports only this
  macos.py        Quartz, AX, AppleScript, Vision OCR                     (macOS adapter)
  windows.py      Win32, UI Automation, pynput, Windows.Media.Ocr         (Windows adapter)
  perception.py   capture, OCR, block merging, goal-echo filter
  dates.py        date parsing and "in N days" hints
  decide.py       state, criteria, the three-Choice request, the Noul check
  writer.py       the writer model, structured replies, URL validation
  actions.py      one handler per action, each returning a history line
  runner.py       the step loop, run folder, stop rules
  report.py       logging, annotated screenshots, payload dump
  cli.py          `clicker` and `clicker-inspect`
tests/            pure logic: dates, merging, reading order, echo filter, config, decisions
```

An adapter is about twenty functions, listed in `host.py`. A Linux port would provide them
over xdotool and AT-SPI with PaddleOCR or RapidOCR. Nothing else knows the platform.

Windows differences worth knowing: Windows OCR reports no per-line confidence, so every
line passes the OCR confidence gate. The process is made DPI aware, so the capture, the
mouse, and UI Automation all agree on physical pixels. `frontmost_app` reports the
executable name (`chrome`, `msedge`, `code`), and `activate` and `open_site` match on it.

## Known limits

- OCR only sees text. Icon-only buttons and text over photos are invisible or garbled.
- Two identical labels get only a coarse region hint and split the vote.
- Only the main display is captured. On Windows that is the primary monitor.
- Using the machine during an `--act` run fights it for focus and the cursor.
- The site catalog is small on purpose; the writer covers the rest.
